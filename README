Phases included: P, pP, sP, PcP, pPcP, sPcP, S, sS, ScS, sScS and all crustal (source and receiver regions) reflected phases et al.
distance ranges: 30deg. to 90 deg.

Multitel3_absolutetime
t1 and t2 are the arrival time for P and SH respectively.
t3 is for the beginning of waveforms
user1 is the takeoff angle for P
output is in cm with a moment of 1e20 dyne cm

There are two input models:
sp6(could change the name and use different model, such as ak135): source and receiver crust model for Haskell matrix
format:
#model
source_layer_num vp1 vs1 rho1 thickness1
                 vp2 vs2 rho2 thickness2
                 ...
receiver_layer_num vp1 vs1 rho1 thickness1
                   vp2 vs2 rho2 thickness2
                   ...

raysp6prem: 1D standard model for ray thoery
format:
layer_num
dep1 vp1 vs1 rho1 qp1 qs1
dep2 vp2 vs2 rho2 qp2 qs2
...


There are three output files:
sp6_10: The improved Green's functions containing both direct and core-reflected phases
sp6core_10: PcP and ScS Green's functions
sp6direct_10: traditional P and SH Green's functions
